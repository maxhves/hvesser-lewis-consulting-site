### Personal website

Please feel free to go ahead and take a look at the site hosted at [hvesserlewis.com](https://www.hvesserlewis.com).

The site aims to give a bit of an overview about me and some of the projects that I am and have been working on. You'll
find the following main areas when looking at the site:

- About
- Experience
- Projects
- Contact

#### Tech stack

The site has been created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with Typescript as the preferred language, and the project 
furthermore makes use of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for easy styling.

Take a look at the code/site, perhaps as inspiration for your own site, and feel free to use it as an
example, but with any code directly taken, attribution is greatly appreciated.
