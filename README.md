### Hvesser-Lewis Consulting

This repository hosts the front-end code for the website [hvesserlewis.com](https://www.hvesserlewis.com).

This website is used to promote my personal consultation services, and this repository specifically is kept an as open source project as to proivde a sample to those looking to make a similar website.

### Tech Stack

The project has a fairly standard setup utilizing `NextJS` with `Typescript` and `TailwindCSS` for simplified styling. As the site grows in features, I will update this section with more information about the implementation, but for now there exits a minimal number of pages and complexity.


#### Please note

Take a look at the code/site, perhaps as inspiration for your own site, feel free to use it as an example, but with any code directly taken, attribution is greatly appreciated.
