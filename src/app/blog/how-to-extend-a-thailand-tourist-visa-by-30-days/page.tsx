              How to extend a Thailand tourist visa by 30 days
            </IntroductionTitle>
            <IntroductionPreface>
              If, like me, you&apos;ve recently taken advantage of Thailand&apos;s 60-day visa exemption or 60-day Visa
              on Arrival, you might now be wondering how to extend your stay by an additional 30 days. Official
              information on the process can seem a bit scarce and confusing, so Iâ€™ve put together this guide to clarify
              how you can extend your visa, based on my own recent experience.

              I&apos;d like to start by noting that immigration offices may vary slightly depending on their location
              and specific procedures. So, where it&apos;s relevant, the information I&apos;m sharing here is based on
              my personal experience of extending my 60-day visa exemption in Bangkok.
